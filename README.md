## Optional Login & Sync
Login is built into the site with Supabase. Users can sign up with a username and password (email is not shown), optionally use Google, and sync data across devices. The site still works without logging in.

**Notes**
- The app uses a private internal email address for Supabase auth, but users only see and use their username.
- The desktop navbar shows the username when logged in. Mobile users can access login via **Settings → Account**.
